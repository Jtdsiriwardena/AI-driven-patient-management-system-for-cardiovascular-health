## 🚀 AI Features

### 🔬 ECG Image Prediction  
Medical assistants can use AI algorithms to **instantly predict ECG images**, enabling rapid assessment of cardiac health without requiring a doctor to be physically available. This feature accelerates the **diagnosis process**, especially in emergency situations.

### ⚠️ Risk Prediction  
The system utilizes advanced machine learning models to predict an individual's **10-year risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD)** based on:  
✔️ General medical status  
✔️ Medical history  
✔️ Behavioral factors  

This **personalized risk assessment** helps create customized plans for managing cardiovascular health.

### 💬 AI Chatbot for Patient Support  
An AI-powered chatbot acts as a **virtual assistant**, allowing patients to:  
✔️ Ask questions about cardiovascular diseases  
✔️ Get advice on symptoms and lifestyle habits  
✔️ Learn stress management techniques  

This feature enhances **patient engagement** and provides **instant health guidance**.

## 🧠 AI Models Used

### 1️⃣ ECG Prediction Model  
- **Purpose:** Detects abnormalities in ECG signals.  
- **Input:** ECG waveform data.  
- **Process:** Uses **deep learning techniques** (CNNs/RNNs) to classify heart conditions.  
- **Output:** Predicted classification (e.g., normal, arrhythmia, atrial fibrillation).  
- **Use Case:** Assists in **early diagnosis** of heart diseases.

### 2️⃣ Risk Prediction Model  
- **Purpose:** Predicts a patient’s **cardiovascular risk**.  
- **Input:** Age, blood pressure, cholesterol, BMI, ECG results, medical history.  
- **Process:** Uses **machine learning models** (logistic regression, decision trees, neural networks).  
- **Output:** Risk score (low, moderate, high).  
- **Use Case:** Supports **preventive healthcare** decisions.

### 3️⃣ AI Chatbot Model  
- **Purpose:** Provides AI-powered health guidance.  
- **Input:** Text-based queries on symptoms, risks, and general health.  
- **Process:** **NLP-based model** (GPT or custom chatbot) interprets user questions.  
- **Output:** Text responses with **health advice and risk assessments**.  
- **Use Case:** Enhances **patient engagement** and supports telemedicine applications.
